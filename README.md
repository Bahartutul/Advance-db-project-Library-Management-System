# Advance db project-Library Management System 
A desktop app to keep track of books, readers, suppliers, employees and borrow history of a whole library. Readers can register and by login they can borrow book. I use C# as a programming language and Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 as IDE to finish this project. This project is done by Oracle as database. And use PL/SQL as query language.
